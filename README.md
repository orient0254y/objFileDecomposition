This tool is using to decomposition an obj file to many files by it objects,every small obj file is one part of origin big obj file.
If you want to add them to scene,you just need to create an Object3D and using this Object3D add These obj files,then add to the scene,you will view the whole object in your sceen.
I think it's easy for you.
Specially,if you use google explore to download the files will be ok and fluently.
